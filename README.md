# Prediction using Supervised ML

This project aims to predict the percentage of a student based on the number of study hours using supervised machine learning techniques. This is a beginner-level project that demonstrates how to train and evaluate a linear regression model on a small dataset.

## Dataset
The dataset contains two variables: the number of hours studied and the corresponding percentage of marks obtained by the student. The dataset is available in CSV format and can be accessed through this link: http://bit.ly/w-data.

## Dependencies
The project requires the following Python libraries:

pandas
numpy
matplotlib
scikit-learn
## Usage/Examples

The project can be run on a Jupyter Notebook or any other Python environment. To run the project, simply open the Prediction using Supervised ML.ipynb notebook and execute each cell in order.

## Results

The trained model can be used to predict the percentage of marks obtained by a student based on the number of hours studied. The model achieves a mean absolute error of X on the test set.

## Credits
This project is adapted from the "Data Science and Business Analytics" internship by The Sparks Foundation.
